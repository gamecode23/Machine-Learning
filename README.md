# Machine-Learning
This is a collection of implementations for basic Machine Learning Algorithms coded from scratch.

The Repository contains ipython notebooks for the following topics
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regressio
3. ID3 trees
4. Naive Bayes
5. K-NN
6. K-means


Visualizations are provided to give insights of the data as well as the algorithm specifications.


To use the notebooks


## Requirements: 
Install the latest package of anaconda with python 2.7
	The packages required in the notebooks
	1. pandas        -reading csv files
	2. numpy         -fast mathematical operations library
	3. scikit-learn  -Provides different metrics for evaluation. Also provides many inbuilt machine learning functions   
	4. seaborn       -statistical plotting
	5. Matplotlib    -scientific plotting
	6. jupyter	 - For viewing the files!
	  and ipython

### Steps.
1. Install Anaconda. Install the required packages listed above
2. On terminal<br>
	2.1. Linux: 
	1. sudo su root 
	2. source activate root
	3. jupyter notebook
	
	2.2. Windows: Open cmd as admin
	1. activate root
	2. jupyter notebook

This will automatically open a web page of jupyter.<br>
On right hand side, click on upload and browse all the ipynb files present here <br> 
For running the animation, you will need flash plugin and ffmpeg plugin. Please download from the official site only <br>


The notebooks use of the following datasets
1. IRIS dataset - from UCI repository
2. Kings County housing price database - UCI repository
3. Car feature database - UCI repository
4. Example dataset (find.csv) -  Data Warehousing and mining ,Techmax publication
5. Titanic Dataset - UCI repository


In all the notebooks adjust the address in the second command the one that reads the csv.<br>
All the programs have been made in accordance ot the shapes of their respective data.<br>
Changes in the data files may break the code.
